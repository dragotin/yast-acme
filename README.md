This is the Yast ACME Module
============================

This Yast module allows to retrieve X509 certificates from certificate
authorities such as [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via the [ACME
protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-05).  It currently
depends on [dehyrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated).

Both projects are [packaged for
openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:dmolkentin:acme).
